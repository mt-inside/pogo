# Title
ADR 1: Command-line interface

# Context
Want to offer more and better features than pomo, but unsure exactly what
Risk of getting code design wrong if rough shape of features aren't known up-front
Designed to be primarily CLI-driven.
Modern CLIs are of the form [cmd verb noun...] with flags anywhere
Many golang CLIs are implemented with Cobra, which I would like to learn
Cobra first use will be slow

# Decision
We will impliment the CLI client first, using Cobra
Before coding we will sketch out a CLI command set

# Status
Accepted

# Consequences
CLI need now be designed
