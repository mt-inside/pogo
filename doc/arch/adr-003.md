Keys, IDs, consistent naming
consistent map to small ints is hard. Maybe map to "foo bar baz" then
open-chaining i.e. use the first three chars of the hash and if there's a
clash, keep adding one until you avoid it

Or just hash the contents and render the minimum hash prefixes to get
uniqueness?

Task type contains everything needed to describe it including the index.
Don't split that info into the hash map, not least cause it's then
difficult to go from Task to index, and becuase that map is just one index
over tasks - there may be another e.g. a Trie for title-based lookup at
some point.
