#On filtering 
Task::List filters by default (only tasks, only TODO, only current category), but Start, Complete etc don't (i.e. they don't check that the ID they've given exists under any particular filter). The decision was taken that because list does filtering, they're likely only to then submit IDs in their current "context", but are free to use anything if they know it somehow (and the server shouldn't reject things like that as e.g. background tools might be doing all kinds of funny things).
